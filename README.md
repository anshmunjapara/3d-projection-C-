3D Cube Projection in C++ with SFML

This project is a 3D Cube Projection program written in C++ using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). It renders a rotating 3D cube in a 2D window, with options for automatic and mouse-controlled rotation.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

	â€¢	main.cpp: The main file containing all code for rendering, transformations, and user input handling.
	â€¢	Button class: An interactive UI button that allows users to toggle between automatic and manual rotation modes.
	â€¢	3D to 2D Projection: Converts 3D cube vertices into a 2D plane for display.

ðŸŽ® Features

	â€¢	3D Rotations: The cube rotates along the X, Y, and Z axes using matrix transformations.
	â€¢	Interactive Button: Users can switch between auto-rotation and mouse-based manual rotation. The button responds to hover and click actions, changing color and text dynamically.
	â€¢	SFML Graphics & Input: Utilizes SFML for rendering graphics and handling user events, keeping the code straightforward and efficient.
